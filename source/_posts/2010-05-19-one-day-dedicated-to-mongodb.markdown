On June 21st 2010 I highly recommend you to attend ["the MongoFR"](http://www.10gen.com/conferences/event_mongofr_21june10), an event devoted to [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com).


I am lucky to participate in this event. I will speak about my experiences on
migration from SQL to MongoDB based on what I've learned working on the [Oupsnow](http://oupsnow.rubyforge.org) project.

In my opinion, this new technology is both really interesting and promising.

If you want to discover MongoDB, come by on [June 21st](http://www.10gen.com/conferences/event_mongofr_21june10).
