Errbit was [release for the first time](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2010/08/24/introducing-errbit) in August 24 2010 by Jared Pace.

Errbit is not dead. It's actually maintained and used for the past 3
years and now, I'm proud to announce the release of
errbit. There was not real release from the start, but I think it's
needed. I do this first one with 0.1.0. Errbit do a lot of thing but can
do better. I hope try to do this challenge with the Errbit Team and try
to release more often this application.

A Changelog is now available to see what change in your favorite error
catcher application. I have not list all thing errbit can do, but I list
some new improvement in last couple of month. You can find it on [github](https://github.com/errbit/errbit/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
